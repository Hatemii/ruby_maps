# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# 1.upto 5 do |pet|
#   Pet.create!(
#     name: "pet_#{pet}",
#     description: "description", 
#     species: "species", 
#     breed: "breed", 
#     lost_on: Time.current, 
#     last_known_latitude: 1.1, 
#     last_known_longitude: 1.1
